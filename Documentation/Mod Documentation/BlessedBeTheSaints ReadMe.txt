==Blessed be the Saints==
  *     By Aeven      *




-- Description --
A higher resolution on all of the saint depictions found on Temple shrines. 

-- Installation --

Extract the folder named Textures into Data Files, which is commonly found under "C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind", unless you installed it somewhere else, which you should likely remember if this is the case.

People using this are likely to be using a different replacer already, with afore mentioned meaningless replacements. If it asks, just choose to overwrite.

-- Credits --

Aeven (me) for the replacement
Bethesda for the original depictions
