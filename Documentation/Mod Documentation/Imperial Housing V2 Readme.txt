The files contained within replace the textures for the Imperial housing.


Version 2 Changes: 

I have added 5 improved mipmaps to each texture which will get rid of most of the noise that was evident in the version 1 textures while hopefully retaining most of the detail in the textures.


Installation:

All files go into your Morrowind> Data Files> Textures folder. 


Permissions:

These textures are free use for anything that is Morrowind related.
