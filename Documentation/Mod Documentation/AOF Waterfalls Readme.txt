V1.1

The files contained within replace the meshes and textures for the waterfalls with bump and reflection mapped versions.



Fixes:

Saved the normal map as a 32bit dds and added an alpha channel. This should fix some of the pixelation and should fix the problem
some people experianced with the waterfalls not rendering as intended.

Corrected filtering modes on the waterfall models, which should also help eliminate pixelation.

Fixed collision issues. You should now be able to pass through the waterfalls.



Installation:

DDS files go into your Morrowind> Data Files> Textures folder. 

NIF files go into your Morrowind> Data Files> Meshe> "X" folder


Permissions:

The textures are free use for anything that is Elder Scrolls related. 

The waterfall models are modified versions of Bethesda's original models and are strictly prohibited from use outside of Morrowind.

Thanks to Hrnchamd for helping me fix the issue some people had with there systems properly rendering the waterfalls. 
And also for pointing out my failure to switch the filter mode on a couple of the models.

Thanks to Vurt for pointing me in the right direction on how to fix the collision.
