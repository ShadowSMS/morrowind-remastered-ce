Name: Unique Finery Replacer UFR

Category: Models and Textures
Requirements: Tribunal & Bloodmoon
Author: Alaisiagae 

Description
===========
Gives most special and unique amulets, belts, rings, robes, shoes, and amulets new, unique models.


Details
=======
Gives most special and unique amulets, belts, rings, robes, shoes, and amulets new, unique models. All textures are actually vanilla textures, so they will look even better (hopefully!) with any texture replacers you use. New icons have been made, too. 

!!! THIS MOD WILL NOT MAKE AMULETS, RINGS, AND BELTS APPEAR ON YOUR CHARACTER WHEN EQUIPPED! This mod just gives them new ground meshes, so they'll look pretty on your shelf. The new icons will also make them handy to spot in your inventory. !!!

FEATURES:
- replicates MPP changes to items that my .esp alters, so that you can get the same fixes.
- Includes the changes made to the Templar, Imperial, and Indoril Belts from my Soldiers Belts Mod
- includes pluginless fixed meshes and icons for the vanilla artifact rings, 6th House artifacts, as well as some other clothing items. They are pluginless, so if you don't like them, you can delete them. Mostly, I fixed booger vertex colors and improved the UV maps (less texture stretching/distortion)
- edited Gloves will have right and left icons, as well as left and right ground meshes (if applicable).
- Now includes the ring texture fix. The original Ring Texture Fix mod is here: http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&id=1327

>>>>Includes .esp versions that don't make any changes to the robes (not even enchantment changes)

WARNING: If you aren't running the Morrowind Code Patch, strange things might happen to you if you enable this mod with any of the modded items equipped on your character. (I lowered the weight of some of the artifact 6th house amulets)

- .esp is clean
- tested extensively

- Try using Yacoby's Close Inspection mod ( http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Mods.Detail&id=6879 ) to be able to see all the lovely detail on those itsy bitsy rings. 

>>>>DON'T FORGET: Back up any meshes in your Meshes\c folder that have the same file name as those listed in this readme's "Uninstall" section. Just add ".bak" to the file name to create an inactive BAK file. For example: "c_ring.nif" -> "c_ring.nif.bak". If you want to revert, delete my file, then rename the old file such that "c_ring.nif.bak" -> "c_ring.nif"


===================
Big List of Changes
===================
*I might have missed a few things, it's not easy keeping track of stuff I've worked with on-and-off for over a year. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Misc Stuff I Did
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Some very minor name tweaks/corrections:
- "Belt of Sanguine Impaling Thrus" -> "Belt of Sanguine Impaling" (why bother with "thrust" if only "thrus" is displayed in-game?)
- "Ring of the Rive Fingers of Pai" -> "The Five Fingers of Pain"
- "Embroidered Belt" -> "Peakstar's Belt"

!!!NOTE: "[insert name here]" means just that.I didn't feel like typing them all out. Besides, did you really want to read two pages of mesh names?!

I might have missed something in this list. To be absolutely sure you get everything, look at the .zip for this mod so you can see which items you need to remove.


Upgrade
=======
1. Uninstall the old mod.
2. Install the new mod.
3. Start Morrowind and play. There should be no effect on saved games and should not corrupt any saves.


Incompatibility
===============
This mod will conflict with another mod that edits the Indoril, Imperial, and Templar belts. Versions of the MPP higher than version 1.6.4 should include the fix for these mods. Honestly, it doesn't matter if this mod overwrites that, as they make the same changes. If you are running my Soldiers Belt Fix mod, you can deactivate and uninstall it, as this mod includes that mod.

This mod will conflict with all other mods that edit the items listed in the Big List of Changes earlier in this readme.

CANADIAN ICE'S ROBE REPLACER MOD: will conflict with my robe edits. Use the "no robe" .esp included in this mod.

D.I.Y. FIXES: You can selectively remove my edits with the Enchanted Editor (download my UFR_MEE_Tutorialv1.zip tutorial).


Known Issues or Bugs
====================
WARNING: If you aren't running the Morrowind Code Patch, strange things might happen to you if you enable this mod with any of the modded items equipped on your character.

ENCHANTMENT GLOW: Peakstar's Belt and the Ralen Family Belt will look odd when you see the plastic-wrap-enchantment; this is because parts of the mesh allow for transparent textures, but the glow-wrap will still outline the mesh, even if it is supposed to be "transparent." Try using a "no-glow" mod or a mod that changes or reduces the plastic-wrap effect. Or ignore the issue.

I think I've got everyone, but, having worked on this update for over a year, I didn't always properly keep track of who helped with what. If you remember helping me with the mod and don't see your name here, please contact me so that I can give you credit. Thanks for making these and letting me (and modders in general) use these beautiful meshes.

Vince, I couldn't determine from your website and readme if you required modders to ask for permission to use your mod. If you don't want me to use your textures, please contact me.
