Name: Propylon Pillar Retexture - Glowmapped!
Version: 1.0
Date: 9/2/2008
Category: Models and Textures
Authors: Alaisiagae


Description
===========
Replaces Propylon Pillars textures with crisp, hi-res, glowmapped textures.


Details
=======
This mod contains new, hi-res textures for all ten of the active propylon pillars (found in the Propylon Chambers). Textures and meshes have been glowmapped (courtesy of Plangkye).

+ Spelling of the destination name on the pillars is now consistent with the spelling of the destination stronghold: 
++ "Falagmaryon" corrected; now spelt "Falasmaryon."
++ "Andraseth" corrected; now spelt as "Andasreth."

+ I used dongle's excellent "Oblivion Script" font. See the "Credits" section for a link.


Install
=======
1. Extract the files to a temporary location.
2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.
3a. Copy files to (install folder)\Morrowind\Data Files\. When asked to overwrite the "Textures" and "Meshes" and "I" folders (if you already have them), click "OK."
3b. If you are uncomfortable with the above method, then simple copy the twenty textures (see "Uninstall" section of the readme for the names) directly to your Textures folder. The, copy the 10 meshes directly to the Meshes\I folder.
4. Start Morrowind Launcher and play.

!!!The path names for the textures and meshes should look like the path names listed in the "Uninstall" section of this readme.!!!
