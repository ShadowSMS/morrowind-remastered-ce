Better Dialogue Font 1.1
Author: Hrnchamd


Description
-----------

This is a high resolution replacer for the Magic Cards font, used in most of the UI - menus, dialogue and the journal. It should provide improved clarity without changing the font size.

The font is derived from the original version specific to Morrowind, changed to be slightly heavier and blacker, as well as being double resolution. Letter kerning (letter pair separation) is improved for the most noticeable misaligned letters - BQRTVchkmnw. It also improves translated dialogue by correcting all the misaligned accented characters, and ess-set.


Installation
------------

Compatible with versions of Morrowind that use the standard Latin character set. May display incorrect characters if your localization uses different characters.

1. Extract archive to Data Files directory.
2. Your life has become one part less blurry.


Uninstallation
--------------

1. There is a backup folder inside the fonts folder with the original font file. Copy it to the fonts folder.
