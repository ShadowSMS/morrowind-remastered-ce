Licensing/Legal
===============
You can do whatever you want with this mod but all I ask in return is that you give Psymoniser credit if you use/modify the meshes, and give me credit if you use the icons. If you have any questions, contact Psymoniser or myself.

The new mesh is a modification of the wolf creature head (a Bethesda-made mesh). Therefore, you may not legally import this mesh into another game (such as TESIV) and distribute it as a mod.
