==You just got Frescoed!==

-- Description --
This will change the two frescoes used in Velothi (Vivec, temples, Vos et c.) to higher resolution ones, 
with the same depicted, rather than what most replacers do, which is to replace them with meaningless depictions of a Greek battle scene or a Chinese dragon, or something to that effect. Instead, these keep the wonderful depictions of Saint Veloth guiding his people away from the Altmer and into Resdayn (today known as Morrowind) and the Tribunal (Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec, also known as Almsivi). These frescoes are very high resolution, and are likely to look good with most replacers that keep the same general feel (and colour scheme.) In the preview screenshots, Connary's Veloth's Sons is used, but most will look great with these. 

-- Installation --

Extract the folder named Textures into Data Files, which is commonly found under "C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind", unless you installed it somewhere else, which you should likely remember if this is the case.

People using this are likely to be using a different replacer already, with afore mentioned meaningless replacements. If it asks, just choose to overwrite.
