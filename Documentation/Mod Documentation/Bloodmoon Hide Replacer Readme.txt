Description
===========
Replaces the Bear, Snow Bear, Wolf, and Snow Wolf ingredients so that they look like pelts instead of mutilated heads.


Details
=======
This mod changes the meshes and textures of the wolf and bear ingredients so that they look like pelts/hides instead of chopped-off, gory heads. Now you can decorate your homes with luxurious fur pelts. The meshes are the same as the pelts decorating the walls, but the textures are completely new. All textures are hi-res, 512x512 in .dds format. Custom icons with alphas (transparency) are included. Does not require an .esp.

+ Heremod Production's "Realistic Pelts" mod inspired me to create my own version. I used the meshes from his/her mod, but the textures and icons are completely new.

+ To get the pelts decorating the walls to look as pretty, download my Bloodmoon Pelt Replacer mod.

In Version 2.0: 
- pelt meshes oriented correctly (no longer upside-down when placed in-game)
- adjusted vertex colors on all pelts
- adjusted pelt UV maps (no more squished or stretched textures)
- improved the icons for all pelts
- made the gray wolf pelt use the same mesh as the white wolf pelt. Now the wolf pelts have one type of mesh, and the bear pelts have a bigger, slightly different-shaped mesh.

Upgrade
=======
1. Remove the previous version's textures.
2. Add the new version's textures.
3. Start Morrowind and play. There is no effect on saved games and shouldn't corrupt any saves.


Incompatibility
===============
This mod will conflict with another mod that modifies the exact same textures, icons, and meshes (see the "Uninstall" section for the names of the files contained in this mod).

This mod IS compatible with mods that modify the properties of the hides - such as mods that change price, name, weight, alchemical properties.

Heremod's mod will take precedence over this one because it uses an .esp. I don't know if there will be conflicts if you attempt to use both at once. I would suggest removing the files that came with Realistic Pelts if you want to use my mod.


Known Issues or Bugs
====================
None that I am aware of. If something is wrong, let me know.
