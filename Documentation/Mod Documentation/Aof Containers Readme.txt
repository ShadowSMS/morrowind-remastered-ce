The files contained within replace a few of the container models and or textures. New barrels, kegstand, wooden bucket, and optional new textures for the sacks.


Installation:

DDS files go into your Morrowind> Data Files> Textures folder. 

NIF files go into Morrowind> Data Files> Meshes> "F" "M" and "O" folders accordingly.


Permissions:

The textures are free use for anything that is Elder Scrolls related. 

The new barrels and kegstand are modeled and textured by me and are free use within the realms of The Elder Scrolls Morrowind and any susequent games if you might feel so inclined.

The bucket model is a remapped version of Bethesda's original model and is strictly limited to use in Morrowind only.

If you wish to use any of my work outside of The Elder Scrolls please send me a request note before hand.
