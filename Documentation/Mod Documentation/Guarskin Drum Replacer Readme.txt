Description
===========
Gives the guarskin drum a unique model.


Details
=======
This mod gives the guarskin drum a new model that uses a - surprise! - guarskin texture. Same mesh as misc_de_drum_02.nif, so there should be no oddities in the game world (i.e. floating drums). Comes with a new icon, too!

- requires an .esp
- .esp cleaned


Install
=======
1. Extract the files to a temporary location.
2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.
3. Copy files to (install folder)\Morrowind\Data Files\
4. Start the Morrowind Launcher, click 'Data Files', place a checkmark beside the .esp.


Uninstall
=========
1. Start Morrowind Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file(s).
2. Delete the .esp file from \Morrowind\Data Files\
3. Delete the following:

Meshes\Alais\m\drum_guar.nif
Icons\Alais\m\drum_guar.dds


Upgrade
=======
1. Uninstall the old mod.
2. Install the new mod.
3. Start Morrowind and play. There is no effect on saved games and should not corrupt any saves.


Incompatibility
===============
Will conflict with any mod that edits the mesh and/or icon of the Guarskin drum.


Known Issues or Bugs
