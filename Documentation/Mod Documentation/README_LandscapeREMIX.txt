     1. INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

*****************************************************************

To install the plugin, unzip the files into the "Morrowind/Data Files/" directory.

Have the latest morrowind patch installed.
If you only have 128mb's of system ram you may not be able to run this plugin(not fully tested on lesser capable machines).

If by chance you get errors loading the plugin.  You may have to convert the .dds textures in the /textures/landtx/ directory to TGA files(if you find this difficult to do please wait for an updated .esp).  You must have the .dds plugin for photoshop or paint shop pro in order to do this.

*****************************************************************

     2. PLAYING THE PLUGIN

*****************************************************************

From the Morrowind Launcher, select Data Files and check the box 
next to LandscapeRemix_v1.esp file.

This plugin uses modified textures new and old(bethesda) that more or less give better visual quality overall to the landscapes of morrowind. NEW in 2.0: Static boulders, swamps and rocks now retextured.

*****************************************************************

     3. Save Games

*****************************************************************

This plugin will not invalidate your old saved games. If you save 
your game while this plugin is loaded, you may encounter error messages 
when you reload the saved game without the plugin. But you will be
able to continue on with the original game.

     5. Credits & Usage

*****************************************************************

-Dirt textures from Nvidia's Transmogrifying Textures vol. 1.0 were used.

-Original Bethesda textures were also used. Some were retiled to a higher resolution and some were resized and retouched by me.

-Other sources were anonymous.

-And some textures were created by me with my digi cam.

You may use the textures within the plugin to repaint your own landscapes as long as they aren't packaged for commercial use or profit.
