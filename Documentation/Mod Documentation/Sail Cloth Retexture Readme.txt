Name: Sail Cloth Retexture SCR - Normal
Version: 1.0
Date: 9/21/2008
Category: Models and Textures
Author: Alaisiagae 

Description
===========
Replaces the four sail cloth textures with higher resolution textures that maintain the look and feel of the originals.


Details
=======
I haven't seen too many sail cloth replacers, so I decided to make one! This mod replaces the three longboat sails, and the single galleon sail. All the textures are 1024x1024 in .dds format (except two that are 512x1024, I don't know what Beth was thinking when they made that half-furled longboat sail mesh). 

+ No .esp needed

+ Only needs Morrowind


Install
=======
1. Extract the files to a temporary location.
2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.
3. Copy files to (install folder)\Morrowind\Data Files\
4. Start Morrowind and play.


Uninstall
=========
Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_longboatsail.dds
Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_longboatsail01.dds
Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_longboatsail01a.dds
Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_longboatsail01b.dds
Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_longboatsail02.dds
Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_sail.dds


Upgrade
=======
1. Uninstall the old mod.
2. Install the new mod.
3. Start Morrowind and play. There is no effect on saved games and cannot corrupt any saves.


Incompatibility
===============
This mod will conflict with another mod that replaces the sail textures. If the mod uses an .esp, then that mod will probably overwrite this one anyway.


Known Issues or Bugs
====================
There shouldn't be any. This is a simple texture replacer and does not require any .esps. I doubt there will be any effect on the game's performance.


You may preview these textures with such free programs as Irfan View ( http://www.irfanview.com/), Windows Texture Viewer ( http://developer.nvidia.com/object/windows_texture_viewer.html ) or another dds viewing program (use google to search). Such a program will let you view the textures without having to start up your game.
