Name: Ore Rock Retexture ORR - New Glass
Version: 1.0
Date: 9/17/2008
Category: Models and Textures
Author: Alaisiagae


Description
===========
Replaces the three ore veins and the raw ingredients (which protrude from the veins) with high resolution textures.


Details
=======
This mod replaces the textures for the Diamond, Ebony, and Glass ore vein rock textures. It also replaces the textures of the nodules that protrude from the ore rocks; these textures will also replace the textures for the corresponding ingredients. Ore rock textures are 512x512. New ingredient/crystal textures are 256x256. All are in .dds format.

+ This does not require an .esp

+ Note that the ebony ingredient texture in this mod is different than the texture from my Soulgem Ingredient Retexture mod. Both ingredient textures will look fine on the new ebony ore rock texture, but the new ingredient texture will match better with the ebony ore rock texture.

+ If you don't like the new green I've used, then you may download the "Vanilla Glass" .zip file, which contains a glass ore rock texture that will match the vanilla raw glass texture. No replacement texture for the raw glass ingredient is present in that download.


Install
=======
1. Extract the files to a temporary location.
2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.
3. Copy files to (install folder)\Morrowind\Data Files\
4. Start Morrowind Launcher and play


Uninstall
=========
To remove all or part of this mod, delete the files associated with this mod.

Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_rock_glass_01.dds
Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_rock_ebony_01.dds
Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_rock_diamond_01.dds
Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_raw_glass_01.dds

Upgrade
=======
1. Uninstall the old mod.
2. Install the new mod.
3. Start Morrowind and play. There is no effect on saved games and cannot corrupt any saves.


Incompatibility
===============
This mod will conflict with another mod that changes the same textures. If that mod uses an .esp, then that mod will likely overwrite this one anyway. If not, then you will need to decide what textures you want to appear in the game.

You may preview the textures with such free programs as Irfan View ( http://www.irfanview.com/ ), Windows Texture Viewer ( http://developer.nvidia.com/object/windows_texture_viewer.html ) or another dds viewing program (use google to search). Such a program will let you view the textures without having to start up your game.

The ebony texture in this mod is different (and, in my opinion, better) than the one I made for my Soulgem Ingredient Retexture mod. The new Ebony ore rock texture will look fine with either raw ebony texture.


Known Issues or Bugs
====================
There shouldn't be any. This is a simple texture replacer and does not require any .esps. I doubt there will be any effect on the game's performance.
