Description
===========
Adds Bethesda-style splash screens for Morrowind.


Details
=======
This mod adds several splash screens to the game, done in the style of the Bethesda Splash Screens.

You can remove any of these that you don't want.

===Morrowind===
+ Fire Atronach
+ Frost Atronach
+ Storm Atronach
+ Guar
+ Text translation: "But it is said that Nerevar will come again and cast down the false gods" - Nerevar Moon-and-Star ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nerevar_Moon-and-Star )

+ No .esp needed

+ Thanks to Nzdawghaus for his splash pack resource (see the Credits section of this readme), without which I wouldn't have attempted to make something like this.


Install
=======
1. Extract the files to a temporary location.
2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.
3. Copy files to (install folder)\Morrowind\Data Files\
4. Start Morrowind and play.


Uninstall
=========
Delete the following textures:

Morrowind\Data Files\Splash\splash_fireatro.tga
Morrowind\Data Files\Splash\splash_frostatro.tga
Morrowind\Data Files\Splash\splash_stormatro.tga
Morrowind\Data Files\Splash\splash_guar.tga
Morrowind\Data Files\Splash\splash_textnerevar.tga


Upgrade
=======
1. Uninstall the old mod.
2. Install the new mod.
3. Start Morrowind and play. There should be no effect on saved games and should not corrupt any saves.


Incompatibility
===============
This mod will conflict with another mod that contains a splash screen with the same exact name as any of the splashscreens in this mod. If that happens, simply rename the splash screen, there will be no negative effects from doing so.


Known Issues or Bugs
====================
There shouldn't be any. Splash Screens are in the correct dimensions (1024x1024) and format (targa, 24-bit). If you are looking at them with Irfan View (or any other image-preview program), they'll look kind of squished, but that's how all of Bethesda's splash screens are supposed to be. Your game will stretch it to the correct dimensions.
