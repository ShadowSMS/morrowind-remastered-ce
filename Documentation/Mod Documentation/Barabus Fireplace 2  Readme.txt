Barabus' Fireplaces

I'll keep this brief,installation couldn't be simpler just unzip the files to the Morrowind data files directory, the meshes can be found
in their own barabus folder within the meshes folder. If upgrading from a previous version uncheck the original and clean your save, the 
two mods are not compatible as both add meshes to the same locations.

You don,t need either Tribunal or Blood moon and it isn't reliant on any other mod being installed.

What does this add? As the name suggests, FIREPLACES. Nice ones, you'll find them in every imperial town across Morrowind,they use
a number of original meshes and textures so make a big difference to the game world.There are also a few new miscellaneous items 
for the purpose of dressing them up, kettles, saucepans etc.

Changes in Barabus' Fireplaces 2

In a word - everything. All meshes have been rebuilt and redesigned along with all of the textures - now in more efficient DDS
format. I have taken the time to remove the more incongruous designs and replace them with more appropriately styled fireplaces. 
The fireplace meshes have also been renamed so as not to interfere with the original models when used in other peoples mods, however 
the kettles, saucepans and logs will be overwritten as will a number of the textures. That said I would recomend any modder to swap to the 
newer models if atall possible. Placement of the meshes in the Imperial towns remains practically the same although there are more 
fireplaces installed than in the original release.

Feel free to use these meshes in your own mods just remember to give me a nod in the credits, we unemployed artists need all the 
advertising we can get! A mention for my website would also be appreciated the address is http//www.freewebs.com/barabus/

Thankyou for installing this mod. Any useful feedback is appreciated, I can be contacted by private message at the Official Elder Scrolls
forums or by E-mail at bloodbank51@hotmail.com.
