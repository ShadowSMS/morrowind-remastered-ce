Date: 12/18/2010
Category: Models and Textures
Requirements: Tribunal
Author: Alaisiagae 

Description
===========
Replaces the cart cloth found in Tribunal with a higher resolution texture that maintains the look and feel of the original.


Details
=======
This mod replaces the texture for the cloth found on the carts in the Great Bazaar in Mournhold. The texture is hi-res, 512x512, in .dds format. Texture mainatins the original look and feel of the vanilla texture - it even has the correct number of blue and white stripes!

Also replaces the cart mesh with the same mesh, but with tweaked vertex shading and UV map.

+ No .esp needed


Install
=======
1. Extract the files to a temporary location.
2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.
3. Copy files to (install folder)\Morrowind\Data Files\
4. Start Morrowind and play.


Uninstall
=========
Delete the following:

Morrowind\Data Files\Meshes\x\ex_mh_bazaar_cart_01.nif
Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_cart_cloth.dds

Upgrade
=======
1. Uninstall the old mod.
2. Install the new mod.
3. Start Morrowind and play. There is no effect on saved games and cannot corrupt any saves.


Incompatibility
===============
This mod will conflict with another mod that replaces the cart cloth texture or cart mesh. If the mod uses an .esp, then that mod will probably overwrite this one anyway.


Known Issues or Bugs
====================
There shouldn't be any.
