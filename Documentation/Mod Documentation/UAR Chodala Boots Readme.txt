Name: Unique Armor Replacer: Chodala's Boots
Version: 1.0
Date: 1/19/2010
Category: Models and Textures

Description
===========
Gives Conoon Chodala's Boots a different/new mesh, texture, and icon.


Details
=======
Uses Silaria's Boots Resource by Mandamus as the new meshes for Conoon Chodala's Boots. These knee-high boots use a vanilla texture, and I've given them a new icon, too. Conoon Chodala was an Ashlander, so I used a cool ashlander shirt texture that worked fantastically well with the boots. Go make those other ashkhans jealous of your awesome boots!

- The groundmesh for boots was tweaked by Bodvar to be consistent in appearance with the other armor boots groundmeshes. 

- Nothing else about the boots (armor protection, health, enchantment) has been changed.

- .esp required

- .esp has been cleaned with ESCOG.

- Better Bodies is not required. I have tested both with and without BB running, and BB does not seem to affect the boots.


Install
=======
1. Extract the files to a temporary location.
2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.
3. Copy files to (install folder)\Morrowind\Data Files\
4. Start Morrowind and play.


Uninstall
=========
1. Start Morrowind Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the .esp file.
2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.

Delete the following:

UAR_ChodalaBoots.esp

Icons\Alais\a_boots_chodala.dds
Meshes\Alais\a_boots_chodala_lf.nif
Meshes\Alais\a_boots_chodala_rf.nif
Meshes\Alais\a_boots_chodala_GND.nif


Upgrade
=======
1. Uninstall the old mod.
2. Install the new mod.
3. Start Morrowind and play. There should be no effect on saved games and should not corrupt any saves.


Incompatibility
===============
This mod will conflict with another mod that changes the mesh and/or icon for Conoon Chodala's Boots.


Known Issues or Bugs
====================
There is some slight clipping at the top of the boot with some pants and some greaves. Not all of them, but a few will clip with the top edges of the boots. There's not much I can do about that.

If you find any other problems, please let me know.
