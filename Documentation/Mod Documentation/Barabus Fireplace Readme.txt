I'll keep this brief,installation couldn't be simpler just unzip the files to the Morrowind directory,the meshes are in their
 own barabus folder within the meshes folder.

You don,t need either Tribunal or Blood moon and it isn't reliant on any other mod being installed.

What does this add?As the name suggests,FIREPLACES.Nice ones,you'll find them in every imperial town across Morrowind,they use
a number of original meshes and textures so make a big difference to the game world.There are also a few new miscellaneous items 
for the purpose of dressing them up,kettles,saucepans etc.

 Feel free to use these in your own mods just remember to give me a nod in the credits,we unemployed artists need all the 
advertising we can get!

Thankyou for installing this mod and rate it if you like it!Any useful feedback is appreciated,I can be contacted by private mail on
the Morrowind mod Summit.
