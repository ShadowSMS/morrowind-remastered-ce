Name: Bloodmoon Pelt Replacer
Version: 2.0
Date: 12/28/2008
Category: Models and Textures
Author: Alaisiagae


Description
===========
Replaces the three decorative pelts found in the Bloodmoon expansion with realistic, higher resolution fur textures.


Details
=======
This mod replaces the bear pelt, white wolf pelt, and red wolf pelt textures found in various buildings on Solstheim with a more realistic fur texture. Textures are 512x512, in .dds format. The texture is from a free texture site (see the "Credits" section of this readme).

+ This mod requires Bloodmoon; if you don't have Bloodmoon, these textures won't do anything, nor show up in your game. 

+ All three textures use the same base fur texture, the only difference is the coloring. The pelt meshes have not been altered.


Install
=======
1. Extract the files to a temporary location.
2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary.
3a. Copy "Textures" folder to (install folder)\Morrowind\Data Files\. If asked whether to overwrite the Textures folder, click "OK."
3b. If you are not comfortable with the above method, you may instead copy the three .dds textures directly to your Morrowind\Data Files\Textures folder (if it already exists). See the "Uninstall" section to see what the correct path files should look like.


Uninstall
=========
1. Delete the files associated with the mod.

Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_bearskin_rug.dds
Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_redwolf_rug.dds
Morrowind\Data Files\Textures\tx_wolfskin_rug_white.dds

There is no effect on saved games and cannot corrupt any saves.


Upgrade
=======
1. Remove the previous version's textures.
2. Add the new version's textures.
3. Start Morrowind and play. There is no effect on saved games and cannot corrupt any saves.


Incompatibility
===============
I'm not aware of any texture replacers that replace these exact same textures. If there is a mod that replaces the textures, then you must choose which textures you want in your game.


Known Issues or Bugs
====================
There shouldn't be any. This is a simple texture replacer and does not require any .esps. I doubt there will be any effect on the game's performance.

You may preview these textures with such free programs as Irfan View ( http://www.irfanview.com/ ), Windows Texture Viewer ( http://developer.nvidia.com/object/windows_texture_viewer.html ) or another dds viewing program (use google to search). Such a program will let you view the textures without having to start up your game.
