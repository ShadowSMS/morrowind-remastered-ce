The files contained within replace the Vivec and Velothi textureS.



Fixes:

Removed erroneous alpha channel from some of the textures. If you could see little white specks (holes) in parts of the buildings this update will fix the problem. 

Set file path so that those who use BAIN can install or remove more easily.

Added building textures that were not changed from V2 but were not included in the V3 pack.



Note:

Statues and UV fixes for the buildings from V2 are not included in this pack. I plan to remodel the statues from scratch at some point, and fix some other issues with the buildings before I make any update with those included.



Installation:

DDS files go into your Morrowind> Data Files> Textures folder. 



Permissions:

The textures are free use for anything that is Elder Scrolls related.
