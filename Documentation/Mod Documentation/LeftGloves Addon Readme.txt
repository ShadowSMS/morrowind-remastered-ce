Description
===========
This mod adds Left and Right icons and ground meshes for the pauldrons and gauntlets of all the armors added in the Bloodmoon and Tribunal expansions, as well as the four new types of cloth gloves added in Bloodmoon. Also contains the files from Lurlock's Left Gloves.


Details
=======
Inspired by Lurlock's Left Gloves mod, I have created visual left and right icons for the pauldrons, gauntlets, and gloves added in Bloodmoon and Tribunal; Lurlock's Left Gloves mod only changes the pauldrons/gauntlets/gloves in Morrowind. Specifically, I have changed the Wolf Armor, Snow Wolf Armor, Bear Armor, Snow Bear Armor, Ice Armor, Nordic Mail Armor, Royal Guard Armor, Her Hand Armor (enchanted and unenchanted), Dark Brotherhood Armor, and Adamantium Armor Gauntlets and Pauldrons (both Left and Right), as well as the four new gloves added in Bloodmoon (both Left and Right). 

- Also includes "leftified" ground meshes for the pauldrons, gloves, and gauntlets. Lurlock changed the left Pauldrons, gloves, and gauntlets already placed in cells have the appropriate lefty ground meshes.

- affects enchanted gloves, gauntlets, and pauldrons (if applicable) in Morrowind, Tribunal, and Bloodmoon (where applicable).

- This mod has been thoroughly cleaned with TESTool.


Install
=======
1. Extract the files to a temporary location.
2. Examine the folder structure and make corrections where necessary. I don't think you'll need to.
3. Copy files to (install folder)\Morrowind\Data Files\
4. Start Morrowind Launcher, click 'Data Files', place a checkmark beside the LeftGloves_Addon_v2.esp file.

!!!Do NOT have Lurlock's LeftGloves.esp and LeftGloves_Addon_v2.esp running at the same time! LeftGloves_Addon_v2.esp will implement the same changes made by the LeftGloves.esp, rendering the LeftGloves.esp redundant!!!


Uninstall
=========
1. Start Morrowind Launcher, click Data Files, uncheck the LeftGloves_Addon_v2.esp file.
2. Delete the files/folders associated with the mod.

Delete all contents (or, the entire "Lefty" folder) of the Lefty folder found in Meshes and Icons:

Data Files\Meshes\Lefty
Data Files\Icons\Lefty


Upgrade
=======
1. Uninstall the old mod.
2. Install the new mod. Make sure to read the readme for standard installation instructions.
3. Start Morrowind and play. There should be no effect on saved games and should not corrupt any saves.


Incompatibility
===============
This mod will conflict with mods that alter the same items that I have edited. I have edited all pauldrons and gauntlets/gloves (both left and right versions) from Bloodmoon and Tribunal. You can run both mods at the same time, but only changes made by one of the mods will be applied when you play the game. The mod towards the bottom of your load order will take precedence. Use a plugin manager, such as Wrye Mash, to change the load order of your plugins. You can get Wrye Mash here: http://wrye.ufrealms.net/#WryeMash


Known Issues or Bugs
====================
I don't think there are any bugs. PM me on the forums if you find anything, and I will see what I can do to fix it!
