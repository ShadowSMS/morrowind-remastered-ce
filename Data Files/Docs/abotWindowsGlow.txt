Compatible/expansion to Windows Glow by Max a.k.a. ~NOBODY~
Compatible with Spuzzum's interior daylights, though both mods will add
lights to interiors.

The mod can be used alone, but it works better as expansion to
Windows Glow, especially in Pelagiad and Caldera.

from, if you know, please inform me.


NOTES:from version 1.7b abotWindowsGlowTR.esp does not include 
abotWindowsGlow.esp anymore, you have to load both.
Sorry, but this really helps me with updates when TR_Mainland.esm changes.

Mods like abotWindowsGlowTR.esp replacing many object references need to be properly updated when masters change.
I will try to release a updated abotWindowsGlowTR.esp as soon as possible when a new version of TR_Mainland.esm is released,
but in the meantime you may want to use Mash replacers to update abotWindowsGlowTR.esp.
Here is the procedure:
1. extract/install new released TR_Mainland.esm as TR_Mainland_new.esm (do NOT overwrite/replace the old TR_Mainland.esm)
2. in Mash, right click TR_Mainland_new.esm, Updaters..., remove any updater already present in the list, add the old TR_Mainland.esm
3. in Mash, click abotWindowsGlowTR.esp having old TR_Mainland.esm as master, right click TR_Mainland.esm on the File column to the right,
 Change to... TR_Mainland_new.esm, click save button below. This way hopefully Mash will be able to remap changed references correctly.
4. copy new TR_Mainland_new.esm over old TR_Mainland.esm
5. click click abotWindowsGlowTR.esp, right click TR_Mainland_new.esm on the File column to the right, Change to... TR_Mainland.esm, click save button below.

Tech info / tweaks:
For better frame rate, it is suggested to try disabling some of the dynamic lights while keeping
the glow effect

open the game console and enter:

set ab01wgLightsOff to 1
to randomly skip 75% of lights (general suggested setting),

set ab01wgLightsOff to 2
to completely skip lights

set ab01wgIntLightsOff to 1
to skip interior lights.

To see and debug placed lights markers, type
set ab01debug to 26

setting values back to 0 will reset to default behaviour (all lights on, debug off)


Enjoy!
